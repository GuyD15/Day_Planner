# Day_Planner

##Description

This application is designed to save the notes that are stored on the page for the day. It is set for the typical business hours. It is color coded so that you know what is in the past, present, and future. Blue being past, red being present, and green being future. Your input is stored so that if you refresh the page it will not lose your information. It also will display for the current date.

The day planner can help people manage their day. Staying organized helps everyone and this is just another tool people can now use.
